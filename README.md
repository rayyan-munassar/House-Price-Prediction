# House Price Prediction

This data science project is dedicated to predicting house prices using a dataset featuring diverse attributes related to residential properties. Through thorough analysis and modeling, the project aims to create an accurate predictive model for estimating the sale prices of houses.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset encompasses comprehensive information about residential properties, covering various features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and neighborhood characteristics. These factors play a crucial role in influencing house prices.

## Project Objective
The primary goal is to employ machine learning techniques to develop a robust predictive model. Trained on historical data, the model will leverage learned patterns to accurately predict the prices of new or unseen houses.
